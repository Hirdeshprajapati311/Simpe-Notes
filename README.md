# 📝 Notes App

A minimal, responsive notes app built with **React** and **Zustand** for state management.  
This project focuses on logic building and hands-on experience with core concepts like **state handling**, **conditional rendering**, and **UI interactivity**.

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ **Create / Save Note**  
  Write and save new notes using the input box.

- ✏️ **Edit Note**  
  Toggle a note between editable and read-only states.

- 💾 **Update Note**  
  Changes made during edit mode are saved back to state.

- 🗑️ **Delete Note**  
  Remove any note from the list.

- 🧠 **State Management with Zustand**  
  Global state managed through Zustand—simpler than Redux and more readable for small apps.

## 🚀 How It Works

- Uses a **text area** for input, which becomes the content of a new note.
- Notes are displayed in cards; clicking "Edit" turns them into editable areas.
- Clicking **"Save"** after editing will update the note in global state.
- **"Delete"** removes the note from the state list.
